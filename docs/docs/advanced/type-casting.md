Type casting is currently an experimental feature. To convert Plutus data to
JavaScript data structures, you'll need information about the type's shape,
which is stored in a JSON schema. To make this process more convenient, we use a
tool called [Typebox](https://github.com/sinclairzx81/typebox).

```ts
import { Data } from "https://deno.land/x/lucid/mod.ts";

const ListingSchema = Data.Object({
  owner: Data.Bytes(),
  amount: Data.Integer(),
  private: Data.Boolean(),
});
```

Furthermore, we can generate a TypeScript type definition from the data
structure:

```ts
type Listing = Data.Static<typeof ListingSchema>;
const Listing = ListingSchema as unknown as Listing;
```

Cast to plutus data:

```ts
const listing = Data.to(
  { owner: "31313131313131", amount: 5252352323n, private: false },
  Listing,
);
```

Cast from plutus data:

```ts
const listing: Listing = Data.from(
  "d8799f47313131313131311b0000000139108943d87980ff",
  Listing,
);
```

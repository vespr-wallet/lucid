Lucid can be used with or without a blockchain provider, which allows you to
query data and submit transactions. It's recommended to select a provider and
network when using Lucid. Lucid currently supports the `Mainnet`, `Preprod`, and
`Preview` networks, with `Mainnet` being the default selection if no network is
specified. Throughout the entire docs we are making use of the `Preprod`
network.

```js
import { Blockfrost, Lucid } from "https://deno.land/x/lucid/mod.ts";

const lucid = await Lucid.new(
  new Blockfrost("https://cardano-preprod.blockfrost.io/api/v0", "<projectId>"),
  "Preprod",
);
```

Lucid allows you to choose different providers. You also have the option to
implement your own custom provider.
